# Python (Jupyter Notebook)

**CMSE 202 Project Overview**

This comprehensive project is hosted in a GitHub repository and comprises four key components: PCA, SVM, Perceptron, and Logistic Regression, with each segment dedicated to a distinct machine learning model. The primary Jupyter notebook, "astronomy_project_final_notebook.ipynb," serves as the central hub for the entire project, seamlessly integrating all four models. The primary dataset, "Skyserver_SQL2_27_2018 6_51_39 PM.csv," was sourced from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) via Kaggle, offering invaluable insights into three cosmological objects: stars, galaxies, and quasars. To ensure balanced data, the dataset underwent preprocessing, eliminating quasar data points, which constituted only 8% of the original dataset.

Project Components:
1. **PCA (Principal Component Analysis):**
   - A dedicated Jupyter notebook in the "pca" folder focuses on PCA, a technique for dimensionality reduction.
   - PCA was utilized to identify the most influential features contributing to the classification of stars and galaxies.

2. **SVM (Support Vector Machines):**
   - The "svm" folder houses a Jupyter notebook specializing in Support Vector Machines.
   - SVM, a powerful supervised learning algorithm, was employed for data classification and regression analysis.

3. **Perceptron:**
   - In the "perceptron" folder, you'll find a Jupyter notebook that delves into Perceptron modeling.
   - The Perceptron algorithm is designed for binary classification tasks, enabling data to be categorized as belonging to a specific class or not.

4. **Logistic Regression:**
   - The "logistic" folder contains a Jupyter notebook dedicated to Logistic Regression.
   - Logistic Regression was employed to calculate and predict the probability of binary events, specifically classifying stars and galaxies.
   - Additionally, a JPG image file in the same folder showcases the final plot of the logit model used for classification.

This project is a testament to the application of machine learning techniques in the field of astronomy. It offers a comprehensive exploration of different models, insightful data analysis, and a clear presentation of results, making it a valuable resource for understanding and applying machine learning in astrophysical research.
